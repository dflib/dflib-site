# DFLib Java DataFrame Library
DFLib is a lightweight, pure Java, in-memory DataFrame. It provides a unique data manipulation API that allows to process data incrementally in a highly-composable manner. Unlike "big data" DataFrames, DFLib does not require special infrastructure and can be used in any Java application. Out of the box, DFLib supports loading and saving to CSV, Excel, RDBMS, Avro, Parquet, and JSON formats, and works with a variety of data sources (local filesystem, web services, zip archives, etc.). DFLib is fully open source and is distributed under the Apache License.
