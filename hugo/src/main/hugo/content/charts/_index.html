                <h1>DFLib Charts and Dashboards</h1>
                <p>DFLib helps Java programmers to create a few types of data visualizations. The first is
                    <a href="/dflib/docs/1.x/#echarts">visual charts</a> based on DataFrame data. Charts are
                    programmed in Java that outputs JavaScript code based on the API from Apache Echarts library. They
                    can be viewed directly in Jupyter notebooks or embedded in HTML pages. DFLib can also generate
                    its own "dashboards", i.e. full HTML pages with multiple charts based on built-in or user-provided
                    templates.</p>

                <p>Below are some examples of visualizations (dashboards with charts) that can be done with DFLib:</p>
