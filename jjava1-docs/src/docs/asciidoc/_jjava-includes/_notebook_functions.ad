== Notebook Functions

JJava injects a number of static helper methods to access the runtime environment. Here are some examples...

=== kernel()
`kernel()` function returns the kernel object associated with the notebook. This is if you need to access
JJava runtime internals (such as JShell) for any reason:

<1> The `kernel()` function is a static import provided by default in each notebook.

=== display(..)

`display(..)` allows to print objects from anywhere in the cell (not just the last cell statement).
It differs from `System.out.println(..)` in that it will apply custom renderers to the displayed objects
(e.g., a DFLib DataFrame will be displayed as a properly truncated table).

You can also pass a mime type to `display(..)` that would e.g., render a piece of text as HTML, markdown, etc.

=== updateDisplay(..)

You can update existing display elements with `updateDisplay(..)`. Here is an example that will show a refreshing countdown:
